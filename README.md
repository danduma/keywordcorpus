# keywordcorpus
Corpus of citation contexts, manually annotated with keywords by two annotators.

## Data

The data is formed of 100 paragraphs extracted from two different open-access collections of scientific papers: the ACL Anthology Corpus (AAC) and the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMC).

## Annotation

Each paragraph is annotated by two human annotators, who have selected what each of them considered to be the most relevant keywords to extract from that paragraph in order to use as a query to retrieve the originally cited paper, marked by the placeholder **\[CITATION HERE\]**

## Code

Code to read the annotations can be found in the [https://github.com/danduma/minerva] repo.
