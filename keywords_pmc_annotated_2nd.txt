#WORDS: : We hope that you find the open-access system increases wider reading and citation of your papers, and that you will continue to send your quality manuscripts to JCMR for publication. Beside its key role in research, CMR is most frequently used clinically for the carotid arteries where it can be used to characterize thrombus, [CITATION HERE] plaque vulnerability, [other cit] atheroma burden, natural history of progression, and response to treatment. [other cit] However, peripheral artery angiography, [other cit] and the role in investigation of pulmonary hypertension, [other cit] vasculitis and systemic hypertension, [other cit] is also making progress.

#WORDS: : The authors concluded that the experience from this study supports clinical testing of real-time CMR guided needle access or drainage of the pericardial space. In 9 of 11 pigs, real time CMR guidance successfully allowed LV cannulation via the chest, RV free wall and the interventricular septum, and subsequent closure of the RV free wall with an occluder device ; one failure was due to refractory ventricular fibrillation and one from inadequate guidewire support [CITATION HERE]. The septum recoiled immediately and complete healing was demonstrated with oximetry, angiography, CMR and necropsy up to 4 weeks later.

Manganese-enhanced CMR ( MECMR ) can non-invasively assess myocardial calcium influx, and in this study, the authors examined whether myocardial calcium levels are elevated in vivo in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy, the mdx mice ( model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ) and Sgcd−/− mice ( Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy ) [CITATION HERE]. Both mouse models exhibited increased in-vivo calcium influx at an early stage in the development of the cardiomyopathy before left ventricular hypertrophy occurred.

#WORDS: : Recently, Abp1 was found to be essential for an alternative endocytic pathway in yeast, perhaps related to its synthetic lethality with factors central to the conventional CME pathway [other cit]. While purified Abp1 alone shows no effects on actin-filament dynamics or organization in vitro [CITATION HERE], when bound to its ligand Aim3 it can cap actin-filament barbed ends [other cit]. Through this interaction, and its interactions with the Arp2/3 complex and the other binding partners mentioned above, Abp1 may influence actin-filament assembly and turnover in a number of ways.

#WORDS: : Recently, it has become clear that ergosterol and its biosynthetic enzymes are clustered in plasma membrane subdomains referred to as membrane compartment of Can1 ( MCCs ). When these membrane domains are disrupted, there are global consequences on the structure and organization of the plasma membrane ; however, it is currently disputed whether this leads to elevated rates of endocytosis of some cargos or has no effect [CITATION HERE]. Ergosterol was first linked to endocytic functions by the __author lab ’ s identification of a mutation in ERG2/END11 in a genetic screen for endocytosis mutants [other cit].

#WORDS: : As with many cellular structures that are below the resolution limit of standard light microscopy, it has been challenging to assign precise locations to proteins at endocytic sites and to determine how their spatial patterns change during the rapid steps of membrane invagination and vesicle scission. The two most fruitful approaches have been quantitative immuno-EM and correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) [CITATION HERE]. One recent CLEM study concluded that membrane bending begins with actin polymerization [other cit] ; this seems reasonable given that substantial membrane bending requires forces from actin polymerization, especially given the combination of high turgor pressure and a stiff plasma membrane rich in ergosterol [other cit].

However, more recent studies, one using a Las17–GFP fusion with the tag in an alternative position and one using immuno-EM, concluded that Las17 does move in with the membrane invagination ( [CITATION HERE] ). Thus, the field has not yet reached consensus on the locations of NPFs and hence the orientation of F-actin in the cortical patch.

Recent results show that each subunit in a filament formed by muscle actin releases Pi independently, without influence from its neighboring subunits [CITATION HERE]. Thus, each filament is thought to be a unique mosaic of subunits in different nucleotide states, with the growing end of the filament enriched in ATP and ADP + Pi-actin, and the older end of the filament enriched in ADP-actin.

Consistent with this view, purified Crn1 promotes severing of ADP–actin filaments by cofilin in vitro [other cit], and in mammalian systems, coronin, cofilin, and Aip1 have been coisolated from cell extracts as a three-component system that promotes the rapid disassembly of ADP-filaments ( [CITATION HERE] ). The mechanisms underlying these effects for either yeast or mammalian coronins are not yet defined and require further investigation.

#WORDS: : Studies comparing yeast and mammalian Arp2/3 complex activities have revealed some differences that may be relevant, including partial nucleation activity by yeast Arp2/3 complex in the absence of NPFs, i.e., weak activation by F-actin alone [other cit]. However, genetic studies show that NPFs are essential for cell viability and endocytosis ( [CITATION HERE] ) ; thus, nucleation by Arp2/3 without NPFs is not sufficient in vivo. Still, this low-level NPF-independent nucleation activity of yeast Arp2/3 complex could be important during endocytosis ; e.g., NPFs may control network initiation as well as ongoing polymerization at the membrane, while NPF-independent nucleation may contribute to reinforcing the network away from the membrane.

#WORDS: : NPFs directly associate with Arp2/3 complex and actin and serve as cofactors in stimulating nucleation. As mentioned above, there are four known NPFs in yeast : ( 1 ) Las17/WASP, ( 2 ) myosin I ( Myo3 or Myo5 ) in a complex with Vrp1/WIP, ( 3 ) Pan1/Intersectin, and ( 4 ) Abp1 ( [CITATION HERE] ) ( Figure 6 ). Each of these NPFs localizes to actin patches, binds to actin and to Arp2/3 complex, stimulates Arp2/3 nucleation activity to some degree in vitro, and exhibits genetic interactions with Arp2/3 complex and/or other NPFs. Las17/WASP and myosin I ( with Vrp1 ) are categorized as class I NPFs because they bind actin monomers and have strong NPF effects [other cit]. Pan1 and Abp1 are categorized as class II NPFs because they bind to F-actin and have comparably weak NPF effects ( Figure 6C ).

#WORDS: : Similarly, when the metabolic state of the cell changes and cytosolic concentrations of certain compounds are affected ( e.g., amino acids or sugars ), this can again lead to changes in the residence time and trafficking of particular permeases or transporters [other cit]. The general concept of a plasma membrane quality-control system has been proposed, i.e., that there is machinery that detects and removes damaged or misfolded proteins from the plasma membrane, although there is some disagreement on the subject [CITATION HERE]. This suggested plasma membrane quality-control system appears to require the activities of the E3 Ub-ligase Rsp5, much like nutrient-triggered transporter internalization ( Cargo sorting signals and adaptors ), raising the possibility that an intermediate conformation in transporter endocytosis resembles a misfolded protein [other cit].

The second is referred to as a plaque and is flat and larger than a traditional clathrin pit ; these plaques become associated with F-actin as they are internalized [other cit].

#WORDS: : Gmf1, the yeast homolog of mammalian GMF ( glia maturation factor ), is an 18-kDa protein with structural similarity to cofilin [other cit]. GMF is one of four proteins in the ADFH domain superfamily conserved from yeast to humans : cofilin, Abp1, twinfilin, and GMF [other cit]. Gmf1 has little if any binding affinity for F-actin, but binds strongly to Arp2/3 complex ( Figure 7 ) and genetically interacts with cofilin suggesting a role in turnover [other cit]. Gmf1 catalyzes debranching of filaments in vitro without severing filaments at nonbranch locations [other cit]. The debranching activity of yeast Gmf1 is conserved in Drosophila and mouse GMFs [other cit] and depends on separate binding interactions with Arp2 and the first actin subunit in the daughter filament, suggesting a modified cofilin-like severing mechanism for debranching [CITATION HERE]. GMF preferably binds to ADP-rather than ATP-Arp2/3 complex [other cit], suggesting that it targets “ aged ” branches. GMF also inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation by competing with VCA for binding Arp2/3 [other cit]. The in vivo relevance of this latter activity is unclear, but could help inhibit branched nucleation by Arp2/3 complex in the absence of NPFs or suppress branched nucleation at the older ( ADP-rich ) regions of networks to allow filament crosslinkers to act.

#WORDS: : These distribution patterns are under intense study and are likely to be governed by a combination of inputs that include bud site landmarks, regulatory GTPases that read the landmarks, and other factors such as plasma membrane phospholipids, delivery of secretory cargo by fusion of exocytic vesicles, and feedback loops of signaling pathways [other cit]. Interestingly, this may also involve the morphogenetic checkpoint mediated by Swe1 kinase, which arrests mitosis in response to defects in actin organization and bud growth [CITATION HERE]. Recent work in both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae found evidence for Swe1-dependent phenotypes in endocytosis mutants ; combining deletion of SWE1 with a sla1 or sla2 mutation led to an increase in multinucleated cells, indicative of a Swe1-dependent checkpoint acting on ( and regulating ? ) components of the endocytic machinery [other cit].

Another recent finding involves the action of the N-terminal “ LID ” domain found in permeases, a transmembrane cargo family ; this LID domain undergoes a conformational change when the permease is nonfunctional or misfolded, triggering an Rsp5-dependent ( but α-arrestin independent ) Ub modification [other cit].

#WORDS: : Through this approach, they made the landmark discovery that cortical patches form in discrete stages following a stereotypical, temporally ordered program in which endocytic components ( including the clathrin heavy and light chains ) are subsequently joined by actin and actin-associated proteins ( Figure 1 ). Further, mutating the endocytic protein Sla2/End4 led to aberrantly long actin “ comet tails ” at endocytic sites, which allowed the measurement of both the rate of actin turnover [other cit] and the relative positions of key actin regulatory proteins within the actin networks, i.e., at the front, at the rear, or evenly distributed [CITATION HERE]. Next, the __author lab found that sla2∆ mutants and/or treatment with the actin depolymerizing drug Latrunculin-A stabilized clathrin at the plasma membrane.

About 3–7 sec after actin assembly is initiated at the cortical patches, components of the disassembly and turnover machinery begin arriving [CITATION HERE]. During the next 10–15 sec of the actin patch lifetime, there is continued actin assembly, likely concurrent with disassembly, which predicts a highly dynamic actin network.

The COF1 gene is essential [other cit], but partial loss-of-function cof1 alleles generated by scanning mutagenesis [other cit] show defects in patch dynamics just before scission, pointing to an important role for cofilin-mediated actin turnover and remodeling in driving invagination ( [CITATION HERE] 2010 ; [other cit] ). Additional defects are observed at later stages of endocytosis, including a delayed uncoating of actin from internalized vesicles.

How these differences are programmed is not yet understood, but may stem in part from which nucleator is used to initiate the actin network [CITATION HERE]. Further, the relative amount of actin distributed between different types of actin networks ( e.g., patches and cables ) is controlled by homeostatic mechanisms, in which the nucleators in these different structures compete for a limiting pool of G-actin in the cytosol [other cit].

However, other lines of evidence have pointed to twinfilin-promoting actin-filament disassembly or turnover, including : ( i ) twinfilin genetically interacts with cofilin in yeast and flies [other cit] ; ( ii ) genetic perturbation of twinfilin in yeast cells slows actin turnover, and in mammalian cells slows cell motility [other cit] ; ( iii ) twinfilin localizes to sites of dynamic actin turnover in these systems : patches in yeast, and the leading edge or endosomal actin tails in mammalian cells [other cit] ; ( iv ) the C-terminal ADFH domain in twinfilin binds F-actin in addition to G-actin and can interact with the barbed end of the filament [CITATION HERE] ; and ( v ) Twf1 associates with the actin turnover-promoting protein Srv2 in vivo [other cit].
