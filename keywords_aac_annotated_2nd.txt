#WORDS: : Training with a target language model One of the main strength of the phrase-based `` log-linear `` models is their ability to make use of powerful target side language models trained on very large amounts of monolingual texts. This ability is crucial to achieve good performance and has to be preserved no matter the difficulties that occur when one moves away from conventional phrase-based systems ( [CITATION HERE] ). It thus seems appropriate to include a LM feature function in our model or alternatively to define :

Similar to dependency parsing, dominant approaches to phrase-structure parsing include the transition-based method [other cit], which builds an output parse tree by choosing a series of transition actions such as SHIFT and REDUCE, and the graph-based method [CITATION HERE], which explores the search space of possible parse trees to find the best output according to graph-based scores. For English constituent parsing using the Penn Treebank, the best performing transition-based parser lags behind the current state-of-the-art [other cit].

#WORDS: : Our work also borrows from the error detection literature. Researchers have explored error detection for manually tagged corpora in the context of pos-tagging [CITATION HERE], dependency parsing [other cit], and text-classification [other cit]. The approaches to error detection include anomaly detection [other cit], finding inconsistent annotations [other cit], and using the weights assigned by learning algorithms such as boosting [other cit] and SVM [other cit] by exploiting the fact that errors tend to concentrate among the examples with large weights.

#WORDS: : However, as shown in the experiments in [other cit], the whole sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of its parts. Recent work has shifted the focus from overall document sentiment to sentiment analysis based on product attributes ( [CITATION HERE] ). Document overall sentiment analysis is to summarize the overall sentiment in the document, which relies on two finer levels of sentiment annotation : word-level sentiment annotation and phrase-level sentiment annotation.

In [CITATION HERE], __author not only analyzed polarity of opinions regarding product features but also ranked opinions based on their strength. In [other cit], __author proposed Sentiment-PLSA that analyzed blog entries and viewed them as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors.

#WORDS: : Instance selection in a transductive learning framework selects the best instances for a given test set ( Lü et al., 2007 ). Active learning selects training samples that will benefit the learning algorithm the most over the unlabeled dataset U from a labeled training set L or from U itself after labeling [CITATION HERE]. Active learning in SMT selects which instances to add to the training set to improve the performance of a baseline system [other cit].

#WORDS: : Active learning in SMT selects which instances to add to the training set to improve the performance of a baseline system [other cit]. Recent work involves selecting sentence or phrase translation tasks for external human effort [CITATION HERE]. Below we present examples of both with a label indicating whether they follow an approach close to active learning [ AL ] or transductive learning [ TL ] and in our experiments we use the transductive framework.

#WORDS: : In their active learning experiments, they selected 1000 training instances in each iteration and retrained the SMT system. Log-probability ratios [ AL ] : __author develop sentence selection scores using feature counts in L and U, increasing for frequent features in U and decreasing for frequent features in L. They use geometric and arithmetic averages of log-probability ratios in an active learning setting where 200 sentences from U are selected and added to L with their translations for 25 iterations [CITATION HERE]. Later, __author distinguish between features found in the phrase table, x reg, and features not found, xoov.

#WORDS: : We observe that we can obtain a performance within 2 BLEU difference to the baseline system by training on 3000 instances per sentence ( underlined ) using the mean weights and 1 BLEU difference using the union weights. We also experimented with increasing the N-best list size used during MERT optimization [CITATION HERE], with increased computational cost, and observed some increase in the performance.

#WORDS: : Regression has some computational disadvantages when scaling to large number of training instances. Previous work shows that the more the training data, the better the translations become [CITATION HERE]. However, with the increased size of the parallel corpus there is also the added noise, making relevant instance selection important.

#WORDS: : There has been a recent surge in addressing parsing for morphologically rich free word order languages such as Czech, Turkish, Hindi, etc. These languages pose various challenges for the task of parsing mainly because the syntactic cues necessary to identify various relations are complex and distributed ( [CITATION HERE] ). There has also been a lot of interest in building ensemble systems [other cit] and parser stacking [other cit] to improve the overall parsing accuracy by combining the strengths of multiple parsers.
